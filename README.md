# Vibe Editing — starter kit

**Raw footage in → finished, captioned, self-audited vertical clips out, with one command.**

The full short-form pipeline as a Claude Code plugin: ingest → transcribe → mine the best
moments (with a real editorial rubric) → hand-cut → face-track to 9:16 → caption → mix music →
render → 6-gate audit → deliver.

> **🌊 Social Wave team — start here:** tell Claude Code
> *"I'm a new Social Wave editor — clone this repo, read ONBOARDING.md, and set me up."*
> It installs everything for you and runs your first test reel. No terminal work needed.
> (Operating manual once installed: `CLAUDE.md`. Deeper background: `Vibe-Editing-Playbook.pdf`.)

## Quickstart
```
./setup.sh                         # installs ffmpeg + deps, runs a health check
# (optional) paste a free Groq key in plugins/vibe-editing/config/keys.env
/edit <your youtube link>          # in Claude Code   — or:   ./bin/vibe-editing "<link>"
```
Check readiness any time: `python3 plugins/vibe-editing/doctor.py`

## What's INCLUDED — the full method
The complete editorial brain ships here (anonymized): the clip-selection rubric, the cut logic,
the spice caption styling, the audit rules, and the lift patterns. **Out of the box it cuts with
real editorial judgment, not a generic template** — the clips come out to a high bar, and the
6-gate audit rejects anything weak.

## What YOU supply
| You bring | Where |
|---|---|
| API keys (Groq for transcription; Anthropic for best captions) | `plugins/vibe-editing/config/keys.env` |
| Footage | the project's `00_SOURCE/` (or a URL / drive link) |
| Music | your royalty-free tracks → `VIBE_MUSIC=/your/music` |
| Font & brand | swap the bundled free font; set your cover logo / product name |

## What's deliberately NOT in here
Only the things that are pure liability and add nothing to clip quality:
- **API keys** — bring your own (free Groq tier, or `pip install faster-whisper` for local).
- **Licensed fonts** — free **Montserrat** ships instead (looks the same, legal to redistribute).
- **Personal / client data** — real names, revenue figures, and client footage were anonymized
  or removed. None of it is used to make a clip.

## Note on captions
The signature captions transcribe the clip first — so they need a **Groq key** (free tier) or
local whisper. Reframing, cutting, and rendering work without any key.
